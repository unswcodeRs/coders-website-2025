Welcome to **UNSW codeRs** — a volunteer-run club at UNSW for anyone who uses (or wants to use) R for study, research, or fun.

We run regular workshops, maintain online resources, and provide a friendly space to ask questions, share projects, and learn together.

## What we do

:::{.columns}
::: {.column}
### Workshops

We run hands-on R workshops during term and intensives between terms.  
Topics range from:

- R basics and data wrangling  
- Data visualisation  
- Reproducible research and Quarto  
- Modelling, statistics, and more  

Whether you’re just starting out or looking to level up, there’s something for you.
:::

::: {.column}
### Online learning modules

Prefer self-paced learning?  

We’re building a set of short, focused modules you can work through any time, including:

- **Intro to R & RStudio**
- **Data wrangling with dplyr**
- **Plotting with ggplot2**
- **Projects with Quarto**

Each module includes code examples, exercises, and links to further reading.

### Mentoring program

Our mentoring program connects newer R users with more experienced students and researchers.

- One-on-one or small-group mentoring  
- Goal-based support (assignments, research, portfolios)
- Light-weight and flexible — you set the pace

:::

### Help & community

Got stuck on a bug? Not sure how to start an analysis?

We host a **help channel** where you can:

- Ask questions (no question is too small)  
- Get feedback on your code  
- Share tips and resources  

:::

## Upcoming workshops

Our **workshop schedule** includes both on-campus and online events, plus occasional joint events with other groups.

::: {.callout-note}
### External workshop schedule

We also maintain a curated list of external R workshops, conferences, and online events that might interest UNSW students and staff.

[See the full workshop schedule](workshops.qmd)

If you miss a session, you can still follow along with the materials later.

## Online learning modules

Our online modules are designed to be:

- **Chunked** – each module focuses on one idea  
- **Practical** – lots of worked examples in R  
- **Reproducible** – built with Quarto and R Markdown  

A typical module includes:

- A short overview of the topic  
- Step-by-step examples in R  
- Practice exercises  
- Links to additional resources  

---

## Mentoring & peer support

We believe people learn R best **together**.

### Mentoring

- Match with a mentor for a term  
- Get help interpreting documentation and error messages  
- Learn best practices for structuring projects and analyses  

### Peer learning

We also run occasional:

- Code-along sessions  
- Show-and-tell events  
- Study groups around specific topics or packages  

---

## Get help with R

If you’re stuck, you don’t have to stay stuck.

We encourage you to:

1. Share a minimal reproducible example (we can help you with this)  
2. Tell us what you tried and what you expected  
3. Paste in error messages (they’re useful, not embarrassing!)  

You can reach our help channel via:

- Club communication platforms (e.g. Teams)  
- Drop-in help sessions (when scheduled)
