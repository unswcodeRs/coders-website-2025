::: {.hero}
Welcome to **UNSW codeRs** — a volunteer-run club at UNSW for anyone who uses (or wants to use) R for study, research, or fun.

We run regular workshops, maintain online resources, and provide a friendly space to ask questions, share projects, and learn together.

## Online learning modules

Our online modules are designed to be:

- **Chunked** – each module focuses on one idea  
- **Practical** – lots of worked examples in R  
- **Reproducible** – built with Quarto and R Markdown  

A typical module includes:

- A short overview of the topic  
- Step-by-step examples in R  
- Practice exercises  
- Links to additional resources  

---

## Mentoring & peer support

We believe people learn R best **together**.

### Mentoring

- Match with a mentor for a term  
- Get help interpreting documentation and error messages  
- Learn best practices for structuring projects and analyses  

### Peer learning

We also run occasional:

- Code-along sessions  
- Show-and-tell events  
- Study groups around specific topics or packages  

---

## Get help with R

If you’re stuck, you don’t have to stay stuck.

We encourage you to:

1. Share a minimal reproducible example (we can help you with this)  
2. Tell us what you tried and what you expected  
3. Paste in error messages (they’re useful, not embarrassing!)  

You can reach our help channel via:

- Club communication platforms (e.g. Teams)  
- Drop-in help sessions (when scheduled)
