## Online learning modules

Our online modules are designed to be:

- **Chunked** – each module focuses on one idea  
- **Practical** – lots of worked examples in R  
- **Reproducible** – built with Quarto and R Markdown  

A typical module includes:

- A short overview of the topic  
- Step-by-step examples in R  
- Practice exercises  
- Links to additional resources
