Whether you're crunching data daily or just curious about coding, come connect with fellow R users and enthusiasts from across UNSW at the R Community Mixer on 29 May 2025.

Hosted by the UNSW codeRs Club and the School of Population Health R Appreciation Society, this is your chance to:

- Meet and mingle with other R users from all corners of the university
- Discover the R-related groups, initiatives, and support networks already active on campus
- Share your ideas in an interactive session to help shape the future of a university-wide R user community

No R experience? No problem. All are welcome — from complete beginners to seasoned data wranglers.

Join us for great conversations, new connections, and a collective vision for the R community at UNSW.
