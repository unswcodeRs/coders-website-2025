We will then run through some code together on a sample dataset to get a global effect size and heterogeneity, as well as run some meta-regression analyses of potentially important moderator variables. We will also create some plots that are commonly used in meta-analyses. The code we learn in this workshop can be adapted to any meta-analysis dataset from any field.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Classification Trees and Random Forests in R\n\n\n\n\n\n“Random Forests” are used everywhere, and for good reason! Random Forest is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that grows and combines multiple decision trees to create a “forest”. It sounds very complex, but learning to use them is very intuitive, especially if you have a USNW codeRs workshop to help you. \n\n\n\n\n\nJul 30, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatana For R\n\n\n\n\n\nWe live in a data-driven era, where collecting large amounts of information is becoming increasingly more accessible. There is now an unprecedented demand for more flexible and powerful computational tools in order to understand our data. The UNSW Katana computer cluster fulfils this criteria by providing student and staff computational resources to aid their research. One major benefit of Katana is the ability for users to run their computationally heavy analyses remotely - this frees up their own computer for other tasks. While Katana has been described as ‘easy to access’, the initial learning curve can be daunting. In this workshop, I will guide attendees on how to getting started with Katana and how to run analyses on it. I will focus on the application of Katana in the context of ‘R’ analyses, however there over 100 different software available for users to explore. I hope attendees can walk away from this workshop feeling more confident and equipped to use this untapped resource. \n\n\n\n\n\nAug 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoops and beyond: Elegant iteration with the purrr package\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I purrr? Scientific research is often a “broken record” game: we must repeat the same calculations over and over again. In this inaugural UNSW codeRs workshop, Aniko will teach you have to repeat yourself efficiently in R without using copy-paste. \n\n\n\n\n\nMay 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic trees\n\n\nHow to find them and make them pretty\n\n\nPhylogenetic trees: How to find them and make them pretty \n\n\n\n\n\nNov 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Control with Git\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever broken your code and/or lost track of the changes you’ve made? Have you ever trawled through your manual back ups to find some files you’ve hidden away? Have your collaborators ever emailed you code fixes and you struggle to see what has been updated? Maybe Git can help! Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files and also for coordinating work among collaborators. This workshop was designed for beginners and will guide participants in setting up git. We walked through some key git concepts then, put these into into practice during an interactive session.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat R and the Tidyverse can do for you\n\n\n\n\n\nR is becoming a standard method for analysing data, yet at first R can be overwhelming and may seem like a foreign language.
